# genetic-algorithm
With hybrid genetic algorithm to solve the logistics distribution path:  from a logistics center with more than one delivery vehicle delivery to multiple customers, each customer's location and the demand for certain goods, each distribution vehicle load must be, the maximum range of the primary distribution is certain, for reasonable arrangement of the vehicle distribution route, to optimize the objective function, and satisfy the following conditions:  (1) each distribution path each customer's demand is less than the sum of the distribution of vehicle load; (2) each of the distribution path length is not more than the biggest distance delivery vehicles a distribution; (3) must satisfy each customer's demand, and only by a distribution vehicle delivery. Distribution total mileage to be shortest as objective function
